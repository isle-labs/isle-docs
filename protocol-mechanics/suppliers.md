# Suppliers

## Overview

Suppliers are companies that will benefit from getting paid early to finance their operations with working capital.

## Minting Receivable NFTs

Any seller is allowed to mint receivable NFTs, which represent the rights and obligations between buyers and sellers. It should contain the following information:

* **Owner:** The owner of the receivable, which should be the seller when it is first minted.
* **Buyer:** The company who received the goods and has the obligation to pay.
* **Seller:** The company who sold the goods and has the right to be paid.
* **Face Amount**: The amount due for payment at the expiration date.
* **Repayment Date**: The expected date of repayment for the receivable.

## Supplier Onboarding

In order to become a valid supplier for reverse factoring, the supplier will have to send an application to the corresponding **Pool Admin** to get whitelisted. Note that a seller must be whitelisted before they can redeem funds.

## Redeem Funds

After invoices are approved for their suppliers, the suppliers will be able to redeem the principal of the loans at any time using their wallet address.
